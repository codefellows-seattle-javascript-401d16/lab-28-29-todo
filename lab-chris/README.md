## Description
401 JS -- lab 28

Began by taking what I could from Duncan's code and seeing what was broken initially. I got the submit button and input field to show up but was getting errors on everything. Figured out what I did wrong now in note create works.  Started on note item and list. Threw in a basic list item in list and jumped on note putting in the delete button and the content that will be show up in list. Delete button doesn't work. After a while and a ridiculous amount of console logging things I got list to work and have things show up on the page. Started working on the delete button again. Finally got it figured out after an hour or so. There is a weird bug with it but I'll leave it for now. Started trying out some tests. Read some of the docs and tried a few methods but I don't think I'm really understanding how to test the methods in the components themselves. I'll stop here for now.
